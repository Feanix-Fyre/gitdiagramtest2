# ConstructStart_PowerLine

Inherits from `ConstructStart_Base`.

## Description

This class is intended to handle the initiation of the construction process for power lines. Currently, it is an empty class that inherits all its functionality from `ConstructStart_Base`. It likely exists to be paired with a `ConstructUpdate_PowerLine` component on a construction handler prefab.
