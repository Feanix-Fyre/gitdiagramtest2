# EmployeeTrailer

Inherits from `Constructable_GridBased`.

## Description

This class represents an employee trailer building. Currently, it is an empty class that simply inherits all the functionality from `Constructable_GridBased`. It likely exists to be extended with trailer-specific logic in the future or to be used as a specific type for prefab creation.
