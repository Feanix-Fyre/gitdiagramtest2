The Unicode Standard defines combining characters as characters that are combined with base characters to produce a new character. Non-space combining characters do not use character space by themselves when rendered.

Kana type refers to Japanese hiragana and katakana characters that represent phonetic sounds in the Japanese language. Hiragana is used for native Japanese expressions and words, while katakana is used for words borrowed from other languages, such as "computer" or "Internet". A phonetic sound can be expressed in both hiragana and katakana. If this value is selected, the hiragana character for one sound is considered equal to the katakana character for the same sound.</summary>

	/// <summary>Specifies that <see cref="T:System.Data.SqlTypes.SqlString" /> comparisons must ignore the character width. For example, Japanese katakana characters can be written as full-width or half-width and, if this value is selected, the katakana characters written as full-width are considered equal to the same characters written in half-width.</summary>
